Use Twitter OAuth authentication on top of Clearance.

To install:

    script/plugin install git@github.com:thoughtbot/clearance-twitter.git
    script/generate clearance_twitter

If you want cucumber features:

    script/generate clearance_twitter_features

See generators/clearance_twitter/templates/README (displayed when you
generate) for more information.

The cucumber features use WebMock to fake twitter.com OAuth responses.
